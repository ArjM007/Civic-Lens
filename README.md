# CivicLens

CivicLens is an AI-powered civic issue reporting platform designed
for Indian cities.

## Problem
Existing civic complaint systems are fragmented, manual, and
reactive, leading to low citizen participation and slow resolution.

## Solution
CivicLens enables citizens to report civic issues using images.
AI classifies, prioritizes, and routes issues to authorities.

## MVP
The MVP demonstrates the core intelligence loop:
Citizen uploads an image → AI detects issue and severity →
Issue appears on an authority dashboard.
